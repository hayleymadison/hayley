    <p>Hello!  My name is Hayley and I love nature, fiddling, and anything to do with beads!</p>
    <p>My siblings and I have a pretend town in the woods behind our house.
    We named it Sassafropolis.  Why?  Practically any plant you look at is a Sassafras tree.  Did you know that the sassafras tree's roots are used to make root beer?  My grandfather 
    taught me this.  He is very into nature as well, and has taught me the names of many plants
    that I would have otherwise looked past or simply thought to be weeds.  Goldenrod, for instance, is a wildflower that I had thought was a weed, just like dandelions or ragweed.  
    He taught me how to identify wild cherry, persimmon, plum, and sweet gum trees, and how to distinguish between white, virginia, short-needle, and longleaf pines.</p>
    <p>I love to play my fiddle!  When I was four, a violinist came to play for my class because we were studying the letter V.  As soon as I got home, I begged Mom and Dad to let me 
    learn to play the voilin too.  I asked over and over again until at last, when I was seven, they let me begin taking lessons.  At first I was impatient because I was only learning the 
    parts of the violin and the names of the strings and how to pluck.  But then when I started learning to use my bow.  Now, at this point, I was being classically trained.  My voilin teacher
    noticed that I liked to play things much faster than they were supposed to be played.  So one day she brought out a beginners fiddling book that she had bought for me.  Right away I loved it and 
    my favorite part of each lesson from then on was when we would break out the fiddle book. :)  The first tune I learned to play was Cripple Creek, and to this day it remains one of my favorites.
